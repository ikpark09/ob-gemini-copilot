This Obsidian plugin integrates with Google's Gemini API to provide AI-powered writing assistance directly within your Obsidian vault. Boost your note-taking workflow with features like generating note titles, summarizing text, expanding on your ideas, generating hashtags, and creating knowledge graphs, all powered by Gemini.

## Features

* **Summarize Text:** Quickly condense selected text within your notes into concise summaries.
* **Expand Text:** Need to elaborate on a point? Select text and use Gemini to expand on your writing, adding detail and information.
* **Generate Hashtags:** Automatically generate relevant hashtags (#태그) for your notes based on their content.
* **Knowledge Graph:** Analyze relationships between your notes and create automatic links between related documents.
* **Custom Prompts:** Create and save your own custom prompts to use with Gemini.
* **Customizable Templates:** Customize prompt templates for all plugin features to tailor AI responses to your needs.
* **Confirmation Modal:** Review and confirm Gemini's suggestions before applying them to your notes. This gives you control over the AI's output.
* **Interaction Log:** Keep track of your interactions with the Gemini API. The plugin logs each request, including the model used, input prompt, output response, and any errors.
* **Quick Access Menu:** Access all plugin features from a dedicated ribbon icon menu.
